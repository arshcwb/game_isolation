How to play?
Controls:
0 to start the game.
Space for small jump, up arrow for big jump.

Beware, big jump takes time, while small jump can't cross two obstacles simultaneously 

Game difficulty increases with 100,200,400 barrier, where obstacle speed increases first and slows down just in front of bear, creating an illusion.
